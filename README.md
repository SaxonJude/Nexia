# Nexia

This project utilizes Gatsby which is a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps at lightning speed. I found this appropriate for an e-commerce store so the image load speed is snappy and user friendly.

## Built with
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - The React-based framework used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The JavaScript framework used
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - The JavaScript framework used
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Pre-Processor
